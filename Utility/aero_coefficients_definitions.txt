# from Daniel Raymer's Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach

CL - Wing or whole airplane lift coefficient

C_bleed - bleed coefficient (adjust thrust for amount of bleed air)

CD - Wing or whole airplane drag coefficient

CDi - Induced drag coefficient

CD_min - minimum drag coefficient (=Cd0 if uncambered)

CD_wave - supersonic wave-drag coefficient (also CDw)

Cd0 - drag coefficient at zero lift
